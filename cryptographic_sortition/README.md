# Cryptographic Sortition for Proof of Stake in Bazo

Cryptographic sortition is used to randomly select a user who is assigned the right to append the next block to a blockchain. 
The goal of this paper is to analyze existing blockchain protocols based on Proof of Stake (PoS), such as Algorand and Ouroboros, in order to reevaluate and improve cryptographic sortition in Bazo.  

Bazo is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency which recently moved from Proof of Work (PoW) to chain-based PoS. However, the PoS protocol of Bazo has a vulnerability that is exploitable in the event of a fork where validators unintentionally reveal secret information.
